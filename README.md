### Introduction
In this case study I took on the role as Junior Data Analyst for a fictional bike sharing company called Cyclistic:  

In 2016, Cyclistic introduced a bike-share program which has since expanded to 5,824 bicycles and 692 stations in Chicago. The system allows bikes to be picked up from and returned to any station. Initially, Cyclistic's marketing focused on widespread brand recognition and reaching a variety of customers. They offered several pricing options, including single-ride, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Those buying short-term passes are termed casual riders, while those with annual memberships are considered Cyclistic members.

Financial analysis revealed that annual members are more profitable than casual riders. Despite the success in attracting customers with varied pricing, the company sees a greater potential in increasing annual memberships for future growth. The director of marketing suggests that converting casual riders to members could be a strategic move, as they are already familiar with Cyclistic's services.

Their objective is to develop marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. To achieve this, the marketing team aims to understand the differences between annual members and casual riders, the reasons casual riders might convert to members, and how digital media can influence their marketing approach. The team plans to delve into Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to uncover trends that could inform their strategy.

**I was tasked with using data analysis to answer the following question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
