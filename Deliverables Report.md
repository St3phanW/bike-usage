## 1. A clear statement of the business task
The business task is answering the question on how subscribers and customers use Cyclistic bikes differently. By finding out how their usage differs, we can more accuratly target our marketing efforts.
Key stakeholers for this task are the Cyclistic analytics team, marketing team, and executive team, as well as their customers. 

## 2. A description of all data sources used
The data analyzed is company data about the usage in the four quarters of 2019. The data consits of trip details on every single bike ride in 2019. The base file has the following columns, though naming is slightly different in the file of Q3:

trip_id	--> The ID number of the trip <br>
start_time	--> The start time of the trip
end_time	--> The end time of the trip
bikeid --> The ID number of the bike used	
tripduration --> How long the trip was in seconds	
from_station_id	 --> Starting station ID number
from_station_name	--> Starting station name
to_station_id	--> End station ID number
to_station_name	-> End station name
usertype --> Type of user, either a customer or subscriber	
gender --> User gender, either male or female	
birthyear --> User birthyear

As this data is from the company itself, it is determined to be reliable. It seems to be complete, consistent and mostly acccurate. 
There is no private information about the user, so there are no privacy conserns. The data was downloaded and stored on a secured laptop.
